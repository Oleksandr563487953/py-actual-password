"""
Tests do not include two tests - test with
float numbers as arguments (they can be unobviously
generated by some other modules) and test with future
date ('2056, 1, 1' for example). First test will always
be failed, and second will always be passed. Also,
since 'actual_password' is working with datetime.date.today()
- it is necessary to update the test statements at least 1
time per month, or rebuild the whole application.
